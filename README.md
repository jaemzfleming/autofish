# autofish

Automatically right clicks when you Fish in Minecraft.

This is all pretty silly, but I wanted to try fishing overnight and see how much loot I get.

This is a program for arduino micro pro.  If anyone else expresses interest, I'll post plans for the microphone breakout and possibly a headphone jack breakout. 

Currently a work in progress. Not ready for a release.  Stay tuned.
